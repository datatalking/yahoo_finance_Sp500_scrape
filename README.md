## Installation
* The recommended way to install yahoo_finance_Sp500_scrape is PyCharm I've not licensed it yet.
* Updated script for jupyternotebook, python3 and colab imports due to deprications since 2018 when first written
* needed to upload the csv manually as google colab is not very efficent ad you

## Usage

`Yahoo_finance_Sp500_scrape` is intended to be used as a library. In your code, it will mostly
be used for pulling data off Yahoo Finance for machine learning backtesting.



## Features

* Run the script and it will take time to download 500 csv files.
* You load your config file and have it access the LSTM for training.

Not there now, but planned fo the future:



## In Development

* Add coverage tests
  Check tests with `tox`.
